Two years later, Ware became editor of The Morning Post and returned to England. 
With the assistance of Alfred Milner, he obtained an appointment as the commander of a mobile ambulance unit provided by the British Red Cross Society. 
The following year the Army Department of Graves Registration and Enquiries was created with Ware at its head. 
Ware served as vice-chairman.
Post-war, Ware was heavily involved in the IWGC's function. 
In the lead-up to the Second World War, he attempted to use the IWGC's work as a tool for ensuring peace. 
When war broke out, he continued to serve as vice-chairman of the IWGC and was re-appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries.
