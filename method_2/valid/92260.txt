ORCID is a nonproprietary alphanumeric code to uniquely identify scientific and other academic authors. This addresses the problem that a particular author's contributions to the scientific literature can be hard to electronically recognize as most personal names are not unique, they can change, have cultural differences in name order, contain inconsistent use of first-name abbreviations and employ different writing systems. It provides a persistent identity for humans, similar to that created for content-related entities on digital networks by digital object identifiers .
The ORCID organization offers an open and independent registry intended to be the de facto standard for author identification in science and related academic publishing. On 16 अक्टूबर 2012, ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers.
ORCID was first organized as the "Open Researcher Contributor Identification Initiative". A prototype was developed on software adapted from that used by Thomson Reuters for its ResearcherID system. The registry is now an independent nonprofit organization, ORCID, Inc., incorporated in August 2010. Its executive Director, Laure Haak, was appointed in April 2012. ORCID is freely usable and interoperable with other ID systems. ORCID launched its registry services and started issuing user identifiers on 16 अक्टूबर 2012. Formally, ORCID IDs are specified as URIs, for example, the ORCID for John Wilbanks is http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4510-0385. However, some publishers use the short form, e.g. "ORCID: 0000-0002-4510-0385".
ORCID is a subset of the International Standard Name Identifier, under the auspices of the International Organization for Standardization and the two organizations are cooperating. ISNI will uniquely identify contributors to books, television programmes, and newspapers, and has reserved a block of identifiers for use by ORCID, in the range 0000-0001-5000-0007 to 0000-0003-5000-0001. It is therefore possible for a person to legitimately have both an ISNI and an ORCID - effectively, two ISNIs.
Both ORCID and ISNI use 16-character identifiers, using the digits 0-9, and separated into groups of four by hyphens. The final character, which may also be a letter "X" representing the value "10", is a MOD 11-2 check digit conforming to the ISO/IEC 7064:2003 standard.
An ORCID account for a fictitious person, Josiah Carberry, exists as http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1825-0097, for use in testing and training examples.
The aim of ORCID is to aid "the transition from science to e-Science, wherein scholarly publications can be mined to spot links and ideas hidden in the ever-growing volume of scholarly literature". Another suggested use is to provide each researcher with "a constantly updated ‘digital curriculum vitae’ providing a picture of his or her contributions to science going far beyond the simple publication list." The idea is that other organizations will use the open-access ORCID database to build their own services.
It has been noted in an editorial in Nature that ORCID, in addition to tagging the contributions that scientists make to papers, "could also be assigned to data sets they helped to generate, comments on their colleagues’ blog posts or unpublished draft papers, edits of Wikipedia entries and much else besides".
In April 2014, ORCID announced plans to work with the Consortia Advancing Standards in Research Administration Information to record and acknowledge contributions to peer review.
By the end of 2013 ORCID had 111 member organizations and over 460,000 registrants. As of 30 मई 2014, the number of registrants was 727,454. The organizational members include many publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, Wiley and Nature Publishing Group. Others are research institutions, commercial companies including Thomson Reuters, academic societies and a charitable foundation, the Wellcome Trust.
In June 2014, ORCID announced that it had appointed Andy Mabbett as its Wikipedian in Residence.
In addition to members and sponsors, a number of journals, publishers, and other services have included ORCID in their workflows or databases. For example, the Journal of Neuroscience, Springer Publishing, the Hindawi Publishing Corporation, Europe PubMed Central, the Japanese National Institute of Informatics's Researcher Name Resolver, Wikipedia, and Wikidata.
Some online services have created tools for exporting date to, or importing data from, ORCID. These include Scopus and Figshare. Thomson Reuters have enabled data exchange between ORCID and its ResearcherID system, and vice versa.
Third-party tools allow the migration of content from other services into ORCID, for example ODIN, for DataCite and Mendeley2ORCID, for Mendeley.
Some ORCID data may also be retrieved as RDF.
