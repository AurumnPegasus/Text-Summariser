He dwells on the subjects of morality, Dharma, righteousness, etc. in his spiritual songs. His erotic songs worship Lord Venkateswara by describing his amorous and romantic adventures, a tradition now known as Madhura Bhakti. Most of these songs describe the adventures of Venkateswara and Alamel Manga, while others describe the Bhakti of Krishna's devotees. 
He was one of the first few who opposed the social stigma towards the untouchable castes in his era, with his sankeertanas explaining that the relationship between God and human is the same irrespective of the latters' color, caste and financial status, in beautiful yet powerful usage of words in his song "Brahmam Okkate Parabrahmam Okkate..."
His choice of words gives a mellifluous tone to his songs, charming the listener. His prodigious literary career that produced about 32,000 songs, many of which were greatly acclaimed, has earned him a place among the all-time greats of telugu literature.
His meeting with Purandara Dasa in Tirumala. Once when Purandara Dasa visited Tirumala he heard a great old man singing his composition in front of the Almighty Srinivasa. He at once approached the old man and said that the song was composed for practising music. At the same time, Sri Sri Vyasaraya of the Vyasaraya mutt intervened and introduced the great old man as Talapaka Anammacharya to Purandara Dasa. This is one of the major event in the history of Music where two great souls met each other and paid due respect to each other.Purandara Dasa is revered as the Father of Carnatic Music who formulated the music as it is today. The composition Sri Annamacharya sang is like Padumanabha Paramapurusha
An ardent devotee of Lord Venkateswara of Tirupati, AP, Annamacharya successfully composed more than 32,000 sankeertanas in the Carnatic music tradition. Though a great feat in itself, it still falls short of the estimated 475,000 sankeertanas composed by Purandara Dasa. While enjoying popularity in his own days, his compositions were forgotten for over three centuries for some inexplicable reason. They were later found engraved on copper plates, hidden for centuries inside the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala.
Annamacharya considered his compositions as floral offerings to God. In the poems, he praises Venkateswara, describes his love for him, argues and quarrels with the Lord, confesses the devotee's failures and apprehensions, and surrenders himself to Venkateshwara. His songs are classified into the Adhyaatma and Sringaara sankeertanas genres.
Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has been successfully endeavouring to preserve the rich heritage of his compositions. The sustained efforts of dedicated scholars and musicians during the last thirty years have also helped revive their popularity among the Telugu people.
The sankeertanas engraved on copper plates were found in the Tirumala temple just opposite the Hundi, concealed in a very small room. It is said only 12,000 of the 32,000 sankeertanas were found. No leads have been available to trace the remaining sankeertanas. Some personnel involved in deciphering the plates say that the people of those days could have melted the copper plates for personal use.
