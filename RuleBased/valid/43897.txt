बीगलबोर्ड एक मुक्तस्रोत एकल-बोर्ड कम्प्यूटर है जिसका उत्पादन टेक्सास इंस्ट्रुमेन्ट्स, डिजी-की और नेटवर्क एलिमेन्ट्स14 के साथ मिलकर करता है। इसकी डिजाइन मुक्तस्रोत सॉफ्टवेयर को ध्यान में रखते हुए की गयी थी और इसका उद्देश्य टेक्सास इन्स्ट्रुमेन्ट्स के OMAP3530 नामक सिस्टम-ऑन-चिप की क्षमता का प्रदर्शन करना था। 
बीगलबोर्ड की माप लगभग 75 गुणित 75 mm है तथा इसमें एक मूलभूत कम्प्यूटर के सभी कार्य करने की क्षमता विद्यमान है। The OMAP3530 includes an ARM Cortex-A8 CPU, a TMS320C64x+ DSP for accelerated video and audio decoding, and an Imagination Technologies PowerVR SGX530 GPU to provide accelerated 2D and 3D rendering that supports OpenGL ES 2.0. Video out is provided through separate S-Video and HDMI connections. A single SD/MMC card slot supporting SDIO, a USB On-The-Go port, an RS-232 serial connection, a JTAG connection, and two stereo 3.5 mm jacks for audio in/out are provided.
इस बोर्ड पर भण्डारण तथा स्मृति है, more RAM, onboard Ethernet jack, and 4 port USB hub. The BeagleBoard-xM lacks the onboard NAND and therefore requires the OS and other data to be stored on a microSD card. The addition of the Camera port to the -xM provides a simple way of importing video via Leopard Board cameras.
Announced in the end of October 2011, the BeagleBone is a barebone development board with a Sitara ARM Cortex-A8 processor running at 720 MHz, 256 MB of RAM, two 46-pin expansion connectors, on-chip Ethernet, a microSD slot, and a USB host port and multipurpose device port which includes low-level serial control and JTAG hardware debug connections, so no JTAG emulator is required. The BeagleBone was initially priced at $89 USD.
A number of BeagleBone "Capes" have recently been released. These capes are expansion boards which can be stacked onto the BeagleBone Board . BeagleBone capes include but are not limited to:
Launched in April 23, 2013 at a price of $45. Among other differences, it increases RAM to 512 MB, the processor clock to 1 GHz, and it adds HDMI and 2 GB of eMMC flash memory. The BeagleBone Black also ships with Linux kernel 3.8, upgraded from the original BeagleBone's Linux kernel 3.2, allowing the BeagleBone Black to take advantage of Direct Rendering Manager .
BeagleBone Black Revision C increased the size of the flash memory to 4 GB. This enables it to ship with Debian GNU/Linux installed. Previous revisions shipped with Ångström Linux.
The BeagleBoard-X15 was planned for November 2015. It is based on the TI Sitara AM5728 processor with two ARM Cortex-A15 cores running at 1.5 GHz, two ARM Cortex-M4 cores running at 212 MHz and two TI C66x DSP cores running at 700 MHz.The used processor provides USB 3.0 support and has a PowerVR Dual Core SGX544 GPU running at 532 MHz.
The following operating systems are reported to have obtained support for the hardware used on the boards: Fedora, Android, Ubuntu, openSUSE and Ångström. The board also supports other OSes such as FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, QNX, MINIX 3, RISC OS, and Windows Embedded.
On June 29, 2015 the stamp-sized soldering module BeagleCore was announced. It packages the Texas Instruments AM335x ARM Cortex-A8 processor as well as 4 GB 8-bit eMMC on-board flash storage and 512 MB DDR3 RAM into a module for use as a part of embedded systems.
