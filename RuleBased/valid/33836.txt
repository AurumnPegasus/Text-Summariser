मूलतः प्राचीन मेसोपोटामियाई भार एवं मापन कई परिवार शासित नागर-राज्यों, कबीलों अओर व्यवसायी समूहों से निकला था। परिणामतः प्रत्येक नगर, राज्य और व्यापार संगठन के अपने स्वयं के मानक थे, जब तक कि एक घॊषणा उन्हें समान करने हेतु नहीं की गयी। इसके उपरांत सुमेरियाई राज्य ने बहु मानकीय प्लेथोरा को कुछ मानकों तक सहमति दी। सभी लिखित मान, एक परिशुद्ध इकाई मानक के खण्डों में में हैं।
The Greek root of stadios means to stand or have standing, to establish a standard.
In Mesopotamia the problem was that there were several different standards so in the time of Gudea an agreement was circulated between the various city states much like that which is presently being negotiated in Europe.
The weights and measures of Mesopotamia gradually developed with the associated city states. The Sumerian number system uses a base 60 positional notation, and is the origin for the division of 60 for hours and angular degrees. The Akkadian system adopts the Sumerian. Over a period of several millennia international trade and commerce spread the idea of standards of measure based on definitions of land and property throughout the ancient near east. 
International trade required the expansion of the arrangement throughout the ancient Near East as a common standard much like our metric system. The basis of the standard was a definition of a geographic degree divided into 600 parts know as stadia which were further divided into 600 feet.
