इस लेख में आपरेशनल एम्प्लिफायर के सामान्य उपयोगों की जानकारी दी गयी है। सरलीकृत योजनात्मक आरेख का उपयोग किया गया है।
Compares two voltages and switches its output to indicate which voltage is larger. 

Uses negative feedback to invert and amplify a voltage .
Amplifies a voltage 
The circuit shown is used for finding the difference of two voltages each multiplied by some constant . 
The name "differential amplifier" should not be confused with the "differentiator", also shown on this page.
The "instrumentation amplifier", which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high input impedance.
Whenever   R 1  = R 2   {\displaystyle R_{1}=R_{2}} and   R f  = R g   {\displaystyle R_{\text{f}}=R_{\text{g}}} ,
When   R 1  = R  f  = R 2  = R  g   {\displaystyle R_{1}=R_{\mathrm {f} }=R_{2}=R_{\mathrm {g} }} :
Used as a buffer amplifier, to eliminate loading effects or to interface impedances . Due to the strong feedback, this circuittends to get unstable when driving a high capacity load. This can be avoided by connecting the load through aresistor.
A summing amplifer sums several voltages:
Integrates the signal over time

Differentiates the signal over time. 
Combines very high input impedance, high common-mode rejection, low DC offset, and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements
A bistable multivibrator implemented as a comparator with hysteresis.
In this configuration, the hysteresis curve is non-inverting, and the switching thresholds are   ±  R 1  R 2   V sat   {\displaystyle \pm {\frac {R_{1}}{R_{2}}}V_{\text{sat}}} where   V sat   {\displaystyle V_{\text{sat}}} is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier.
Alternatively, the input and the ground may be swapped. In this configuration, the hysteresis curve is inverting, and the switching thresholds are   ±  R 1   R 1  + R 2    V sat   {\displaystyle \pm {\frac {R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{2}}}V_{\text{sat}}} . Such a configuration is used in the relaxation oscillator shown below.
By using an RC network to add slow negative feedback to the inverting Schmitt trigger, a relaxation oscillator is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to oscillate in an endless symmetric square wave .
Simulates an inductor.

Creates a resistor having a negative value for any signal generator
In general, the components   R 1   {\displaystyle R_{1}},   R 2   {\displaystyle R_{2}}, and   R 3   {\displaystyle R_{3}} need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an impedance.
Produces a pure sine wave.
Although there are some limitations, this super diode circuit behaves like an ideal diode for the load   R L   {\displaystyle R_{\text{L}}} .
Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects.
where   I S   {\displaystyle I_{\text{S}}} is the saturation current.
when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:
The output voltage is given by:
